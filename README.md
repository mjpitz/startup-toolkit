Starting a company or looking for some tooling to complement your existing applications?
Here are some tools I've used and how they've helpped.

  - Query across multiple data sources like databases, Google Analytics, and so much more.
  - Easily provide read-only access to your production databases protected by SSO and 2FA.
  - Build, store, and schedule queries to pull information from different data sources.
  - Construct visualizations to better display query data.
  - Create interactive dashboards from queries and visualizations.
  - Self-host or hosted service.
  - Dependencies:
    - [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/)
    - [Redis](https://redislabs.com/)

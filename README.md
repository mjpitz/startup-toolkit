# startup-toolkit

Starting a company or looking for some tooling to complement your existing set?
Hopefully some of this helps.
Currently starting this to track some of the tooling I've used and some of my experiences.

- [Redash](http://github.com/getredash/redash)
  - Query across multiple data sources like databases, Google Analytics, and so much more.
  - Easily provide read-only access to your production databases protected by SSO and 2FA.
  - Build, store, and schedule queries to pull information from different data sources.
  - Construct visualizations to better display query data.
  - Create interactive dashboards from queries and visualizations.
  - Self-host or hosted service.
  - Dependencies:
    - [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/)
    - [Redis](https://redislabs.com/)
